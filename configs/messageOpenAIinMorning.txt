So for fine-tuning, which I assume is the method used for training LORA's, https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/blob/main/docs/config_README-en.md mentions, `metadata_file`. What is this? In all of my thousands of hours of training LORA's, I've never seen this parameter or at least I don't recognize it at the moment.

My toml file is pretty short right now.
